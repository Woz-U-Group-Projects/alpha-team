This file is to document the api calls for localhost/api/login with examples.
This first request is to obtain the web address for a user to authorize/login to our service with twitch.
GET http://localhost/api/login?request=twitchauthlink


If you want to simply link to an internal location and have the api automatically redirect to twitch you can add the redirect=1 to the end of the previous api call.
GET http://localhost/api/login?request=twitchauthlink&redirect=1

In order to check if a user is logged in, which the front end must do before every request. The result will simply be a true or a false.
GET http://localhost/api/login?request=isloggedin

You can also verify which user is logged in without the server responding with the users login name,
we are just confirming is this user who we think it is.
for example:
username who is logged in: john-doe
GET http://localhost/api/login?request=isloggedin&user=jane-doe
result: false
GET http://localhost/api/login?request=isloggedin&user=john-doe
result: true

We can also ask the server for the users logged in username however this will be done through the post method.
POST http://localhost/api/login?request=getloggedinuser
If a user is logged in this will return a status code of 200 meaning request OK, in addition to the users username.
Otherwise this will return status code 403 which means Forbidden, and will state user is not logged in.
